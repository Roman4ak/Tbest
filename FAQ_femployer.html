                            <p>While many of the open positions that job seekers find on Indeed have been collected from around the web by our search engine, employers can also post jobs directly on Indeed. Jobs posted on Indeed are accessible to candidates from both desktop computers and mobile devices and can appear even if your company doesn’t have a career site. It’s easy to post a job in just a few steps.</p>
                            <strong>Step 1: Visit “Post a Job” page</strong>
                            <p>When you click the “Post a Job” button at indeed.com/hire, you’ll be able to open an employer account, from which you can post a new job at any time.</p>
                            <strong>Step 2: Enter the details of your job</strong>
                            <p>Add a clear, concise title and job description, as well as the location of your job. The job details you provide will help match your job to relevant job seeker searches, so check out these tips for creating clear titles and compelling descriptions. Finally, choose the email address to which applicant resumes will be sent.</p>
                            <strong>Step 3: Specify Job Requirements with Application Questions (optional)</strong>
                            <p>If your ideal candidate needs to have certain experience, credentials or skills, you can specify these as Job Requirements. When applying, applicants will be asked if they have what you’re looking for. Requirements can include location, years of specific experience, education level and language proficiency.</p>
                            <strong>Step 4: Decide whether to sponsor your job for extra visibility</strong>
                            <p>Sponsored jobs get more applications than free job listings. “Sponsoring” your job means applying a small budget to keep it prominently displayed. If you choose to post your job for free, it will be most visible to job seekers for the first 2 or 3 days after posting. After that, your job will fall behind newer relevant search results and candidates will have to scroll farther back to find it. The Apply Estimator tool will give you an idea of how many applications you can expect, based on the performance of jobs like yours. If you choose to sponsor your job, you will be prompted to add billing information.</p>
